										<h2>My Passion For Game Dev</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Growing up I always surrounded myself with videogames. It was a medium that I found so intriguing in its diversity. Some games central around fun action packed adventure, others slow and meaningful painting a story with aesthetic visuals, and ones created to bring friends together to enjoy a excitingly fun experience. Once I picked up the fundamentals of coding those very games I played started to develop a whole new meaning as I could pick apart the sequence of entities and scripts that made those games. These days I still enjoy playing videogames, but find myself in a new line of enjoyment learning to form my own games to add to the sea of content out there.</p>

												<h3>Project - Metroidvania</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project is my ode to the metroidvania genre of videogames. The genre basis being games like CastleVania and Metroid centered around exploration and discovery through a sculpted map tackling well designed bosses and minions along the way. This is one of my current projects in the game dev world using the Unity engine with a C++ code base. It is a long ways to go before it will meet my standards for a good MetroidVania, but this project is what I desire to hone into a exciting game one day as I empower my game dev skills</p>
											<p> If you recognize the player sprite than respect thats actually a sprite from a youtuber called Bardent he's been a big help in helping me learn to make 2D games check him out if your curious on game dev hes been a great help</p>

												<h3>Pixel Swap</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Running just keep running. Collect the coins, dodge the spikes, oh there's a wall? No worries! Pixel Swap! Pixel Swap was one of my very first games I developed for the iOS and holds a close place in my heart as one of my first games made. The game is an infinite runner where you collect coins and dodge danagerous obstacles to gain the top score. I am sad to say this but due to recent Swift updates Pixel Swap doesn't run as well as it used to but fear not as with my new Unity engine skills I plan to revamp Pixel Swap and bring it back to its former glory!</p>
